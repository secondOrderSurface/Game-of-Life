# Game-of-Life
A project dedicated to an attempt to model the process of evolution of a multicellular system in a simplified form <br/>
Of course, there are many errors in the code itself and I did not have time to move on to the development of the evolution algorithm itself. 
In this version, the field itself with a grid is implemented, as well as a primitive imitation of weather conditions. Firstly, there are barriers for cells through which they cannot pass. The sun also shines, the intensity of whose radiation depends on the time of day, as well as on whether a certain cell is covered by clouds that move in the sky. Clouds bring rain with them, raising the degree of moisture in a piece of space.
External conditions should play a role, because according to my
assumption, the cells on the board will be autotrophs, requiring water, an atmosphere, a certain climate for life <br/> 
Controls: <br/> 
G - enable / disable the grid<br/> 
C - enable / disable the display of clouds <br/> 
R - solar radiation display mode <br/> 
Space - stop mode <br/> 
Arrows - movement of a test cell, but why? <br/> 
Try to turn off the clouds and you will see a row of beautifully shimmering blue stripes of water. I like to look at it <br/>
